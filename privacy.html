            </h4>
            <p>How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and
                any preferences you have communicated to us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the
                information we collect about you. We use your personal information as follows:</p>

                    We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, secure, integrated and useful to you.
                    We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided to us to
                    troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and
                    improvement of the Services; to analyze and improve our Site and/or Services (including developing
                    new products and services); improving safety; managing our communications; analyzing our products;
                    performing market research; for peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed clinical research; and

                <p>Account Opening Related Data:<br>

                    In order to maintain integrity of the Service, Codebell must take measures to avoid creation of
                    accounts by spammers. Each User Account is unique and associated with an individual. Therefore, a
                    unique identifier is generated and associated with each user. Contact number is used to facilitate
                    messaging service between one or more users of the service. The legal basis for processing is User
                    Consent. You are free to delete your User Account and remove that data in the account panel of your
                    Codebell User account.

                <p>Verification:<br>

                    Such data will only be used to contact you with important notifications about Codebell, to send you
                    information related to security, to send you an invitation link to create your User Account, to
                    verify your User Account, or to send you password recovery links if you enable the option. We may
                    also inform you about new Codebell features in which you might have an interest. You are free, at
                    any given time, to opt-out of those features through the account settings panel. In order to pursue
                    our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of accounts by spam bots or human spammers,
                    Codebell uses a variety of human verification methods. You may be asked to verify using either
                    reCaptcha, Email, or SMS. IP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided are saved
                    temporarily in order to send you a verification code and to determine if you are a spammer.

                    ascertain only genuine users are using the services, and any suspicious activity is reported to the
                    user. The legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest to prevent unauthorized use of
                    Service and protection of user’s interest, thereby maintaining integrity of the Service. Any
